# 3D-Exploration
A 3D Java Maze Game set in space. The player must navigate towards the end of the maze while dodging various traps that can teleport or kill the player. The player should also be aware of the hidden light sources while navigating as it gets progressively darker with each step. It becomes nearly impossible to finish the maze once it is pitch black !

The game uses a Swing GUI to display both the 2D and 3D viewpoints side-by-side and features futuristic music. It also displays the number of steps taken by the player, along with a compass. The player dies if all three lives are lost !
